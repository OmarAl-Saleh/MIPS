# MIPS
## Single-Cycle CPU -phase one
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a single-cycle CPU based on the MIPS instruction set architecture.
## (working) pipeline Cpu -phase two 
## Overview
The single-cycle CPU implemented here is designed to execute a subset of the MIPS instruction set. It fetches and executes one instruction every clock cycle, making it a straightforward design for educational purposes.

## Features
Supports basic arithmetic and logic operations such as ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc.
Load and Store operations for memory access.
will add other soon 

## Directory Structure
Modules/: Contains the Verilog source files for the CPU and its components.

testbench/: Contains Verilog testbenches to simulate and validate the CPU.
